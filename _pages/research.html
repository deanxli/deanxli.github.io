  <summary>Abstract</summary> 
  Firm technology choices shape how firms hire and train workers. Technologically-specific skills also shape how firms compete over workers. To what extent does technological fragmentation create horizontal differentiation among workplaces and drive labor market power? I study this question in the context of electronic health record systems in the healthcare industry. First, I use job postings and a direct survey of nurses to show heterogeneity across electronic health record systems creates meaningful differentiation in the nursing labor market. Nurses report being unwilling to switch technologies and suggest that they would search for a new job or require additional compensation. Next, I show that work experience with specific technologies becomes a meaningful predictor of worker mobility patterns after hospitals adopt these technologies—the friction from switching systems is approximately equivalent to adding 10 - 15 miles of distance between hospitals. Motivated by this evidence, I extend a discrete choice model of worker labor supply to a dynamic setting by allowing forward-looking workers to gain on-the-job work experience and to move across firms. I estimate the present-discounted value of the technological friction to be nearly $23,000. Technological differentiation makes firms more likely to retain existing workers but less likely to poach workers from other firms. I estimate that this additional differentiation generated an 8.0% increase in markdowns and a 5.2% decrease in wages.

  <summary>Abstract</summary> 
  We develop and estimate a dynamic model of risky prescription opioid use that allows us to unpack the role of person- and place-specific drivers of the opioid epidemic and to assess the impact of state opioid policies. Event studies indicate that, among adults receiving federal disability insurance from 2006to 2019, moves to states with higher rates of risky use produce an immediate jump in the probability of risky use, followed by an additional gradual increase for the next several years. Using a potential outcomes framework, we show how these results map to the person- and place-specific factors in the model. Model estimates imply large effects of place on both the likelihood of transitioning to addiction and the availability of prescription opioids; they also indicate that these place effects change significantly when state laws restricting pain clinics are enacted. A one standard deviation reduction in all place effects would have reduced risky use by about 40 percent over our study period. One particular source of place effects, pain clinic laws, reduced risky use by 5 percent, but could have reduced it by 30 percent if they had been enacted earlier, with much of this magnification operating through the dynamics of addiction.

<details data-title="Data, Privacy Laws and Firm Production: Evidence from the GDPR">
  <summary>Abstract</summary> 
  By regulating how firms collect and use data, privacy laws may alter firm demand for information technology inputs. We study how firms respond to privacy laws in the context of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by using seven years of data from a global cloud-computing provider. Our difference-in-difference estimates indicate that, in response to the GDPR, EU firms decreased data storage by 26% and data processing by 15% relative to comparable US firms, becoming less "data-intensive." To estimate the costs of the GDPR for firms, we propose and estimate a production function where firms combine data and computation in firm production. We find that data and computation are strong complements and that firm responses are consistent with the GDPR representing a 20% increase in the cost of data. This increase translates into only a 0.1-0.5% rise in overall production costs because data plays a relatively small role in firm production compared to computation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary> 
  The dramatic rise in service occupations over the past forty years is a key contributor to the increasing occupational polarization that has taken place over this time. While the role of technological change in the “lifting of the tail" has been well-documented, we document an equally important role for rising healthcare demand, which we find explains XX% of the increase in these occupations through its effect on direct-care work. We also show that this dramatic rise in healthcare demand has had a profound impact on female labor force participation, with implications for our understanding of the closing male - female labor force gaps, white - black gaps, and gaps across educational attainment. We reject a benchmark model where these gaps are invariant to sectoral shifts, and we instead use a Roy model to consider the joint effect of healthcare growth on LFP and wage gaps.

  <summary>Abstract</summary> 
  Medicare distributes over $15 billion dollars a year to hospitals for the training of resident physicians, but the hospital-specific division of this funding has been largely frozen since 1997. The spatial distribution of this funding plays an important role in determining the geographic distribution of physicians. This project assesses the potential for reallocation of funding for medical graduate training to redress disparities in physician access across places. To separate the effects of residency location from physician preferences, we leverage a sudden redistribution of residency slots mandated by the Medicare Modernization Act in 2004. We document that hospitals that expanded their residency programs in response to the redistribution increased the number of newly licensed physicians in their local markets, but that these effects are substantially tempered by hospitals who were inframarginal to the additional funding they received. Our results show that the effectiveness of increased residency funding in boosting local physician supply turns on the types of hospitals that are targeted; a substantial share of current funding for physician training is likely a transfer to hospitals.
